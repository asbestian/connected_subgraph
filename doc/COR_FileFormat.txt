Corridor instance format:

Lines starting with 'c' are comments
Line starting with 'p' specifies two integers: the number of nodes in the graph and the number of terminals
Lines starting with 'n' describe nodes in the graph (one for each node) in the following format:
n i b u c e i1 i2 ... ie
where:
i is the id number of the node; i is an integer;
b whether the node is a reserve; b is 0 or 1;
u is the utility of the node; u is an integer;
c is the cost of the node; c is an integer;
e is the number of neighboring nodes; e is an integer;
ij is the id of neighbor node j (j=1,2, ... ,e)
